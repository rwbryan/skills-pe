Steps used to install droplets

000 - Create DigitalOcean CentOS Droplet for linux workspace
      
      OS          = CentOS 7.3.1611 x64
      CPU         = 1
      RAM         = 512M
      SSD         = 20G
      Net         = 1G
      Region      = New York
      Data Center = 1
      SSH Keys (Next Step 001)*
      Choose a hostname
      Click [create]
         (wait a few min for the server to finish installing)
      When the droplet server is finished copy the IP address (you will need it for step 002)
      
001 - Create Public/Private Keys *

      Open puttygen
      - verify SSH-2 RSA is default
      - click [Generate]
          - will ask you to generate random vaules with mouse
              - when finished and the key is generated enter in the passphrase and confirm the passphrase
      - Save the public and private key (remember the path you saved these two files)
      - Add the public key into the SSH keys into the previous step
       
002 - Add new server to putty

      Open putty
      - In the "Host Name (or IP address)" add the IP address from step 000
          root@IP-address
       -> Under Connection (left side window)
              Under SSH
                   Under Auth
                        click on [Browse] and point to the private key you saved from step 001
      - Click on Session at the top left of the putty window
      - In the Saved Sessions box enter a easy to remember name for this host
      - Click on [Save]
 
003 - Connect to new virtual server

      Open putty
      - Select saved config from step 002 in the Saved Sessions and click [Load]
          click [Open]
            This will open a connection to the virtual server
              NOTE: select [yes] if it asks you about a new key set
      - Use the passphrase generated from step 001
      - This will give you access to the virtual server
          
004 - Download doctl (DigitalOcean's command line client)

      - Download doctl from GitHub
      #wget https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl/releases/download/v1.4.0/doctl-1.4.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
      - Extract the tar file
      #tar xf ~/doctl-1.4.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
      - Move the file to the working folder
      #mv ~/doctl /usr/local/bin
      #cd cd /usr/local/bin
      - Verify operation of doctl commands (this command will display current droplets)
      #doctl compute droplet list
      
005 - Enter in the API TOKEN

      - Run command to enter in the API TOKEN (will prompt you when command is run)
      #doctl auth init
            DigitalOcean access token:b68a5870c622bcb08529bac22eedac2ab6bd8115187b97b2c86db3400cb406c5
            Validating token: OK
      NOTE: The location of the token/config file created is in this directory 
	      ~/.config/doctl/config.yaml
            
006 - Create a new SSH key (for new servers)
