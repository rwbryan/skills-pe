Steps used for setting up cloud instance

000 - Create DigitalOcean CentOS Droplet
      
      OS          = CentOS 7.3.1611 x64
      CPU         = 1
      RAM         = 512M
      SSD         = 20G
      Net         = 1G
      Region      = New York
      Data Center = 1
      ->SSH Keys (Next Step)
      Choose a hostname
      Click [create]
         (wait a few min for the server to finish installing)
      When the droplet server is finished copy the IP address (you will need it for step 002)
      
001 - Create Public/Private Keys <-

      Open puttygen
       - verify SSH-2 RSA is default
       - click [Generate]
          - will ask you to generate random vaules with mouse
              - when finished and the key is generated enter in the passphrase and confirm the passphrase
       - Save the public and private key (remember the path you saved these two files)
       - Add the public key into the SSH keys into the previous step
       
002 - Add new server to putty

      Open putty
        In the "Host Name (or IP address)" add the IP address from step 000
          root@IP-address
        Under Connection 
              Under SSH
                   Under Auth
                        click on [Browse] and point to the private key you saved from step 001
        Click on Session at the top left of the putty window
        In the Saved Sessions box enter a easy to remember name of this host
        Click on [Save]
 
003 - Connect to new virtual server

      Open putty
        Select saved config from step 002 in the Saved Sessions and click [Load]
          click [Open]
            This will open a connection to the virtual server
              NOTE: select [yes] if it asks you about a new key set
        Use the passphrase generated from step 001
          This will give you access to the virtual server
          
004 - Create the wannabe account

      Run the following commands
      # useradd wannabe
      # passwd wannabe 
          Password = P@ssw0rd

005 - Change time zone to central time zone
      
      Run the following commands
      # mv /etc/localtime /etc/localtime.bak
      # ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Chicage /etc/localtime
      Run the date command to confirm correct time zone
      # date
          
006 - Setup the ntp service

      Run the following commands
      # yum -y install ntp
      Edit the ntp file
      # vi /etc/ntp.conf
          Comment out the following:
            #server 0.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
            #server 1.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
            #server 2.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
            #server 3.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
          Add the following servers below
            server 0.pool.ntp.org
            server 1.pool.ntp.org
            server 2.pool.ntp.org
            server 3.pool.ntp.org
      Run the following commands to sync ntp
      # service ntpd stop
      # ntpdate pool.ntp.org
      # service ntpd start
      # chkconfig ntpd on
      
007 - Create Script to display current date and time every 10 seconds

    Run the following commands
    # cd /usr/local/bin
    # vi t10.sh
        #Runs date/time every 10 seconds
        while true ; do date & sleep 10; done
   Test the following shell script
    # sh t10.sh
        display should show date and time increments every ten seconds
        
008 - Disable password based login
