Description of files used for the HAspe

Install-RB file
    Document showing the install and config steps.

PK
    Private key used to create new droplets.
    
ruby_create.rb
    Ruby script created to automate the droplet creation process. Was not able to get it to work due to errors. I believe this is 
    the best way to automate the process of creating droplets. Switched over to the Install-RB file to complete tasks.
